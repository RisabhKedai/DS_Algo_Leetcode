'''
To do the DP, We have to track:

    min_diff, which means the min abs diff so far
    last_choose, which means the number we choose last time.

We will go through all indexes. For each index, we have to check if we met the end case first

    If left_k==0 which means we complete the creation of the subarray, so return the min_diff as the power of this subarray

    If left_k!=0 but index==len(nums), which means we are at the end of the nums and haven’t completed the subarray creation, return 0

Now, we will have two branches:

choose: means we will choose the current index as an element of the subarray

not_choose: means we won’t choose the current index as an element of the subarray

    When doing choose, we have to update the min_diff=min(min_diff, abs(last_choose-nums[idx]) and the new last_choose=nums[idx].

    How can we make sure that we get a right min_diff of this index? That's why we have to sort the input nums at the beginning.
    Also remember minus left_k by 1.

    When doing not_choose, we just pass the same min_diff and last_choose

Then return choose+not_choose

We will start with the base case

    idx=0

    min_diff=inf

    last_choose=inf

    left_k=k

Space complexity : O(N^4)
